# Background and History
## The name
"DEFT" stands for "database engine for tasks"

## Goals 
The goal was to develop a simple and portable workflow management system that
could be used as a companion to ATLAS PanDA WMS. Principal features of this
version of "deft" are:
 * Reliance on DAG as the principal model of the workflow, represented as graphs
 * RDBMS as the storage back-end for graph storage
